/**
 * Write an Efficient Method to Check if a Number is Multiple of 3.
 * 
 * The very first solution that comes to our mind is the one that we learned in
 * school. If sum of digits in a number is multiple of 3 then number is multiple
 * of 3 e.g., for 612 sum of digits is 9 so itâ€™s a multiple of 3. But this
 * solution is not efficient. You have to get all decimal digits one by one, add
 * them and then check if sum is multiple of 3.
 * 
 * There is a pattern in binary representation of the number that can be used to
 * find if number is a multiple of 3. If difference between count of odd set
 * bits (Bits set at odd positions) and even set bits is multiple of 3 then is
 * the number.

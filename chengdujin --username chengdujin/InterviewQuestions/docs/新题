Facebook实际题目
1. 把一个binary tree变成double linked list。 也是写一个recursive in-order traversal, update pointer 的时候稍微有点tricky.
2. 第二题是经典的计算 x/y 不用 division operator. 我说用 log 和 exp, 他说可以。又问这些也不能用怎么办。 提示了一下 x, y 都是正整数的话，从 x减去y 一直减到0,看要减多少次，很obvious是bisection 了。
1。merge sort的变种。给一个数组，如果有A[i]<A[N+i]性质，请对数组排序。第一个问题，具体说就是给定一个数组A:A[0],A[1],A[2],...和一个常数N。这个数组的元素有这个特性：A[i]<A[N+i] (i = 0, 1, 2, ....) 问如何对该数组进行排序。其实就是N-way归并算法的变体。
2。给一字符串比如“I like FaceBook”，计算单词数目。
3。写quicksort算法
1. 一个rotated的排序整数数组，比如A=[6，8，1，2，4，5]，写code找一个给定元素，并分析复杂度。其实就是binary search的变体，但是需要考虑两种A[m]中值的情况加以判断。
2. 他谈到facebook的log，如果每个log文件有10 billion行，每行包括timestamp, 
user_id, visited page三个field。如果高效的统计一个月内用户访问量最多的十个网
页。假设文件已经按照timestamp排好序了。不用写code，谈想法就成。我的解法是，
如果内存足够，建立一个<网页,访问数>的hash表，每读入一条记录，该网页key对应的
项加一。但是加入内存不够大，可能需要map reduce方法。面试官马上说，内存根本不
是问题，用个4G或者8G内存来算这个月访问量很值得，不要省内存。然后我说，那hash
表就好了。面试官表示赞许，接着提出引申问题：
3.假设我们已经算了一个月的，如果这个滑动窗口要往前移动一个delta量，就是说，
已经算好timestamp=[t_1..t_x]区间的访问量，要计算timestamp=[t_2..t_x+1]的访问
量，提出高效算法。当然，最brute force的方法就是针对[t_2..t_x+1]再建一个hash
表，显然这不是面试官想要的。我提出来，可以建个multi-level hash表，外层为网页
，内层为timestamp，但是仔细想想也不算好。
1. find 5th smallest element in a binary search tree。地球人都知道，我就不说了。
3。然后问我给定一个FaceBook log file，100 billion行，每一行记录含“timestamp
user_id visited_page”，找到top 10 最长出现的三连串访问模式。比如user先后访
问了页面a,b,a，那么就形成一个模式a->b->a。但是记录没有按照timestamp排好序！
我的答案是，1）brute force：对整个文件先对timestamp再对user id排序，然后建
hash表，读入log文件，对每一个模式计数。 2）map-reduce：将每一个user id对应的
记录读到单独的机器上--map，接着对timestamp排序建hash表，这样效率高些，然后--
reduce，将intermediate结果对每个模式key累加，计算最后结果。然后因为只需要top
10，可以用一个10个元素的min heap维护当前top 10。哥哥满意。
